# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques-TOP-1-
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this Kaggle competition challenges is to predict the final price of each home.
This project consists in competing in the following Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.
The price of houses are different according to some characteristic that impact the global price.
Indeed, ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.
Our goal is also to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id (rows) in the test set, we must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
We found this data prediction contest on Kaggle. Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners (1 million registred user).
Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, we will try to predict the final price of each home the most fit possible with the reality.
To know if the test is conclusive, Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
In this report we do not talk about all the techniques that have been used to clean, transform and optimize our data and algorithms.
The first part of this project includes statistics, clusterings and Data Visualization, then in the second part we have the data preprocessing and finally we have the implementation and the tuning of our Machine Learning algorithms.
